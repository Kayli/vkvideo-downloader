- project uses poetry as venv and dependency manager

- avoid using cd command and assume we are in the project root

    - check changes with diff before generating commit message

- after a code change, run tests with "just test-unit" to make sure you didn't break annything

- before commit, run tests with "just test" command to ensure you didn't break anything

- we are using constructor injection and factories for all dependencies
